# Afterglow IntelliJ

This theme for IntelliJ is based on the the [Afterglow Sublime Text](https://github.com/YabataDesign/afterglow-theme) theme,
and replaces the default sidebar icons and colour of IntelliJ. It should be compatible with all IntelliJ IDEs and has been tested
 with IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate, CLion, AppCode, WebStorm, PyCharm and RubyMine.
The plugin can be downloaded at the [JetBrains plugin repository](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8066)

This theme looks best with the [Afterglow Color Scheme](https://github.com/boneskull/jetbrains-afterglow-scheme) by
[boneskull](https://github.com/boneskull), which implements the Afterglow Sublime Text color scheme.

# Screenshot

Pictures, thousand words etc. Note that Afterglow IntelliJ comes with the original themes found in the Sublime Text plugin,
but the screenshot only shows three. The themes are: Default (White), Blue, Magenta, Orange and Green, the theme can
be switched via the IntelliJ settings dialogue.
